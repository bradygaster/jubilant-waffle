## Setup

### Create the SQL DB in a container
1. Run `docker-compose up` using the `src/docker-compose.yml` file.
1. Use the `mssql` extension for VS Code to connect to the in-container DB to run this script:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE DispatchR
    ```
    This script will create the database and prepare it for being accessed by the Entity Framework components to preload the database with sample data.

### Seed the database with sample geo-data
1. F5 in VS Code to run the `DispatchR.API` **and** the `DispatchR.Web` project simultaneously.
1. If you want to reset (or load-up for the first time) the sample data, hit the `/api/reset` URL to reload the database. 

### See the data coming from the Web API.
1. Go back to the DispatchR UI and click the Step 1 button to load up the initial state.
1. Click on the push pins.
